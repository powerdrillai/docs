## Introduction

The LLM Chat Proxy with Dataset feature is an extension of the [LLM Chat Proxy](/solutions/proxy) feature. This feature allows you to interact directly with the data in the Dataset you created in Powerdrill using OpenAI's Chat client software or service. By using this feature, you essentially build an AI digital assistant based on your private Dataset knowledge base using OpenAI's Chat client software or service.
