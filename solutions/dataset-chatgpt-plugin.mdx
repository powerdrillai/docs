title: Dataset as ChatGPT Plugin
description: 'Create your datasets and publish as ChatGPT plugins, interacting with the OpenAI ecosystem'

This solution scenario allows you to create your own dataset and upload your data into it. Powerdrill will automatically create a REST service interface for this dataset, which complies with the development specifications of the OpenAI ChatGPT Plugin (https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/introduction). This way, you can install your own Dataset as a Plugin on OpenAI's ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4-plugins) and use it within the OpenAI ChatGPT Plugin ecosystem. This is a zero-code approach to integrating your data with the OpenAI ChatGPT Plugin ecosystem. Please note that to use this feature, you must already be a Beta user of the OpenAI ChatGPT Plugin (apply at https://openai.com/waitlist/plugins).

This solution scenario requires just two simple steps:

* Create a Dataset and add your own Datasource data to the Dataset.
* Install the Dataset plugin on OpenAI ChatGPT.

That's it! You can now directly use the Dataset plugin on OpenAI ChatGPT. The ChatGPT Plugin ecosystem allows you to integrate your own data and explore a variety of new data application possibilities.
